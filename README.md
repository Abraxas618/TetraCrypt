TetraCryptPGC: Post-Quantum Cryptography Toolkit
A Secure, NIST-Compliant Cryptographic Framework

Version: 1.0.0 | License: MIT | Maintainer: Abraxas618

🔹 Overview
TetraCryptPGC is an advanced Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) toolkit designed to meet and exceed NIST PQC Standards. It provides a secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready cryptographic handshake leveraging: ✅ Kyber-1024 (Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism)
✅ Falcon-1024 (Post-Quantum Digital Signatures)
✅ Hybrid Key Derivation (HKDF-SHA3) for entropy strengthening
✅ Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Key Sharing for secure distributed cryptographic operations
✅ Hardware Security Module (HSM) & TPM Support for hardware-based key protection

This cryptographic suite is NIST PQC Round 4-ready and is designed for enterprise, government, and defense applications.

🔹 Features
✔ Post-Quantum Secure Handshake (PQ-XDH): Using Kyber-1024 + Falcon-1024
✔ Hybrid Key Derivation (HKDF): Strengthens key material for zero-trust security
✔ FIPS 140-3 Compliance: Supports integration with Secure Boot, TPM, and HSMs
✔ Hardware-Accelerated (GPU/SGX/TPM): Designed for high-performance cryptography
✔ Multi-Party Key Exchange (MPC): Securely shares cryptographic keys across multiple entities
✔ Side-Channel Resistant: Implements secure memory wiping & constant-time operations
✔ Lightweight & Optimized for Containers (Podman/Kubernetes)

🔹 Architecture Overview
🔹 1️⃣ Post-Quantum Key Exchange
Kyber-1024 is used for key encapsulation and secure session establishment, ensuring resistance against quantum computing attacks.

🔹 2️⃣ Digital Signatures & Authentication
Falcon-1024 provides a high-security digital signature scheme, ensuring message authenticity and integrity.

🔹 3️⃣ Hybrid Key Derivation (HKDF)
To further strengthen key security, HKDF-SHA3-512 is used to derive session keys after initial key exchange.

🔹 4️⃣ Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
This allows distributed cryptographic key generation and exchange, ensuring no single point of failure.

🔹 5️⃣ Secure Boot & TPM Integration
Designed for secure enclave environments (SGX, TPM, and HSMs), ensuring hardware-based cryptographic integrity.

🔹 Podman/Docker Deployment
Deploy securely using Podman (recommended for rootless security).

🔹 1️⃣ Build the Secure Image
sh
Copy
Edit
podman build -t tetrapqc .
🔹 2️⃣ Run in a Secure Container
sh
Copy
Edit
podman run --rm --security-opt=seccomp=seccomp_profile.json tetrapqc
