TetraCryptPGC: Post-Quantum Cryptography & Secure Key Exchange Suite

Overview

TetraCryptPGC is an advanced post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) suite designed for secure communication and key exchange in zero-trust environments. It integrates cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Secure Enclaves (SGX & TrustZone), and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to provide a future-proof cryptographic infrastructure.

This version has undergone a full security audit and now complies with:

NIST PQC Standards (Kyber, Falcon, Dilithium)

FIPS 140-3 Compliance

Zero-Trust Security Model

Kubernetes Security Best Practices

SonarCloud Code Quality & Security Fixes

Installation & Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

If Git is working:

git clone https://github.com/Abraxas618/TetraCryptPGC.git
cd TetraCryptPGC

If Git is NOT working:

Download ZIP from GitHub and extract manually.

Use GitHub Desktop to clone the repository.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

For secure execution, make sure you have SGX, TrustZone, and HSM drivers installed (if applicable).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Secure Handshake

To execute the full PQ-XDH Handshake with QKD:

python src/pq_xdh_handshake_mutual.py

4Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Tests

Ensure all cryptographic functions work correctly:

python -m unittest discover tests

Deployment (Kubernetes & Docker)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Kubernetes Deployment

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/tetrapgc-deployment.yaml

Ensure:

Pod security policies are enabled

TLS certificates are properly configured

HSM & Secure Enclaves are accessible in cluster

2Ô∏è‚É£ Podman/Docker Deployment

Podman (Rootless Execution)

podman build -t tetrapgc .
podman run --security-opt=seccomp=default.json --user tetrapgc tetrapgc

Docker Execution

docker build -t tetrapgc .
docker run --rm -it --security-opt seccomp=default.json tetrapgc
